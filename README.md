Hi there !!! :wave:

This is a **Quantum Computing** project in which I used quantum principles such as **_Superposition_** and **_Entanglement_** to develop the <u>**Quantum Image Teleportation Protocol**</u> :star_struck:, which can teleport the quantum state of an image file with high security from sender to receiver who are separated from each other at any distance.
